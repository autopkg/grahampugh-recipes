# JamfPatchChecker

## Description

A processor for AutoPkg that will check and report whether a Patch Software Title has the version that AutoPkg has found or not. This can be used with a subsequent `StopProcessingIf` processor to prevent updating a Patch Policy with a version that does not yet exist in the Patch Software Title, allowing the recipe to run again on a subsequent recipe run.
